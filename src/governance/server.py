"""
Health, readiness, and Prometheus metrics endpoints for ``runner serve``.

These endpoints exist only for the long-lived server process started by
``python -m src.governance.runner serve``. They are read-only observability
surfaces and are never imported by, or wired into, the deterministic
decision path (:mod:`.speaker`). A load balancer or Kubernetes probe talks
to this module; the Speaker never does.

Endpoints:
    ``GET /healthz`` — liveness: is the process alive and has the
        parliament configuration been loaded? This should almost never
        fail; if it does, the orchestrator should restart the pod.
    ``GET /readyz`` — readiness: is the Speaker initialised, is the TEE
        watchdog heartbeat healthy (no deadlock), and is the ontology
        backend reachable? This can flip to "not ready" and back without
        a restart — it just pauses traffic.
    ``GET /metrics`` — Prometheus exposition format, produced via the
        optional ``observability`` extra (``prometheus-client``). If the
        extra isn't installed, this returns ``503`` with a clear message
        instead of crashing the server.

Real-world analogy:
    The health/ready/metrics trio every Kubernetes-deployed service
    exposes: liveness restarts a stuck pod, readiness controls whether
    traffic is routed to it, and metrics feed a monitoring dashboard.
